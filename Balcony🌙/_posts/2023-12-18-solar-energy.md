### _Tafsir_ 

I was reading [Surah Al-Kahf and the Modern Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10331067-surah-al-kahf-and-the-modern-age) by Sh. Imran Hosein and found this paragraph:

> The story, as narrated in Surah al-Kahf is strong suggestive of the use of solar energy for nourishment as well as for propelling motion. **If solar energy can be used for moving a body it can be used for propelling fans, running cars, providing energy for factories etc.** The implication for the believers in this age is that they must prepare themselves to make maximum use of solar energy for survival during the prolonged period of great hardship which will befall them when Dajjal uses oil as the ultimate weapon. He will do so when he finalfy succeeds in seducing the whole world into a complete and irreversible dependency on oil for transportation, travel, food production, industry, etc., and when he forces the price of oil to rise to exhorbitant heights.

that interprets this part of _ayah_:  

>  وَتَحْسَبُهُمْ أَيْقَاظًا وَهُمْ رُقُودٌ
وَنُقَلِّبُهُمْ ذَاتَ الْيَمِينِ وَذَاتَ الشِّمَالِ

Wa tahsabuhum ayqathan wahum ruqoodun 
wa nuqallibuhum thata alyameeni watha taashshimali

You would think them awake, although they were asleep,
And We turned them over to the right, and to the left. (Al-Kahf, 18:18)

### Commentary

Allah SWT has placed the young men in the cave where they still received sunlight from morning until dusk. Their bodies alternately turn over to the right, and to the left, depending on the direction of the sunshine filtered through the cave. They face one cave entrance, where the sunlight enters in the morning, and will roll, turn toward the opposite cave entrance, following the sun's direction.  

This phenomena is called [_phototropism_](https://byjus.com/biology/phototropism/), and it primarily occurs in plants, where plant has the ability to bend towards the direction of the light source.  

Sunlight that fell upon the youth's body stimulates a small energy production that's required for the survival of vital organs, a process known as _photosynthesis_. In plants, this occurs so that they can obtain more nutrition and energy.

Turning light into energy is applied also by humans in the technology of photovoltaics. With the help of semiconductors, it converts light into electricity and harness the abundant power of the sun.

### Takeaways

It's encourged for us to use and shift to renewable energy, i.e. solar cells based on the _ayah_ above, to be independent from fossil fuel that actually could potentially be monopolized by one party, which at the end their prices might skyrocket if there's any scarcity caused by geopolitical issues. Building decentralized energy production is more resilient in the long run, and we should take a part in it.  
For me as someone who deals with science and technology field, this serves as a reminder to myself that advancements in renewable technology hold significance, especially in fulfilling a greater mission during challenging time.
