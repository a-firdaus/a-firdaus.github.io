I’ve been praying that Allah SWT grants me easiness in my _dunya_ (worldly) matters so that I have more time to study Islam and attain the wisdom of it. Aamiin.

As a student who endeavors knowledge, I’m sharing my journey here — the sources that have helped me enhance my understanding of Islam; what Allah SWT desires from His servants – essentially coming back to our fitrah.
Feel free to share your favorite sources (in the comment section below) that have helped you strengthen your faith and find peace in your heart and mind.

May we all find benefit from this small sharing.
