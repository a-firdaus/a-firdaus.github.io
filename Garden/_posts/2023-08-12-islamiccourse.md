Here is a small assortment of Islamic courses/ series that left me unable to unsee the beauty of Islam.

### Modernity

[The Genius of Islam by The Muslim Skeptic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcnL9bB-q3ymnRNcpZGcVVjiDOy-ocjp9) (highly recommended*)  
A mind-blowing series supported by very well-done research and analysis, comparing Islam with modernism, polytheism, and atheism. Perhaps you ever wondered about the matrix of this modern society we live in, then this series by Daniel Haqiqatjou might answer some of your questions.

*Disclaimer: This series offers an anti-mainstream view and unapologetic opinions. If you’re looking for that, I highly recommend this series.

### Marriage

[Wife School by Alasna Institute](https://www.alasna.org/courses/wife-school) (highly recommended)  
Honestly, this is the most comprehensive course about marriage that I’ve ever come across. Although the title itself is “Wife School”, this course is suitable for both women and men since its contents elaborate on both gender.

As someone who has spent one-third of her life in the west, I feel like I’ve turned some life perspectives upside down and without even realizing that it contradicts the _fitrah_. I used to think that men and women have the same capabilities, therefore women should strive the same rights – essentially what I absorb from modern feminism.
However, this course really strucks me hard from the first chapter of Introduction, which explains why women biologically represent the limiting factor in society. This is followed up by the Islamic perspective of how Islam truly protects and values women, upholding their _haya_ (modesty). There exist differences between men and women (Yes, men and women are distinct. As Richard Dawkins put it: it’s “one of the very few genuinely binary things we have in biology”), with each having unique attributes one over the other in certain aspects, not because of weakness but that’s how we complement each other. This difference leads to role divisions in relationships, in a way that we support one another.

I’m truly amazed by the explanations presented by Umm Khalid (the ustadza). The way she has thoroughly researched topics on gender differences and role division (rights and responsibilities) in marriage. Those are mainly supported by the Qur’an, sunnah, and scientific research. I really love the example stories of prophets based on the Qur’an, also Prophet Muhammad’s stories and his _sahabah/ sahabiyyah_, which are grounded in _sirah_.

Those really shift my mindset into striving to align with how _fitrah_ is. Basically, how The Almighty Creator has designed us and how we, as His creation, will function at its best by following His aims – from the atomic scale of family interactions (between wife and husband, children and parents) to the broader structure of society and the _ummah_.
Through this course, I can see the beauty of Islam and I’m ready to embrace its unique way of living, insyaAllah.

### Seerah

[Seerah of Prophet Muhammed by Dr. Yasir Qadhi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAEA99D24CA2F9A8F)  
The best man alive is Prophet Muhammad SAW, and yet, how much we really know about him? He is the most rational and moral person. The era of the Prophet and the _Salaf_ (first three generations) represents the peak of rationality (recognizing the truth) and morality [[1]](https://www.alasna.org/courses/EOD-Dark-Storms). It’s now our turn to follow his footsteps, to learn about his personality, messages he brought and examples he set.

The more we know who he is, the more our love for him will grow. Hence, it’s easier to integrate _sunnah_ (his way of living) into our daily lives, insyaAllah.

The course is incredibly informative. Yasir Qadhi has done a really amazing job in putting everything together into 104 episodes.

These episodes are available both on both [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aln07CIO_BM) and as [podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3cHN4rbGsV0L2GNtieT99c). I usually listen to them while exercising or taking an afternoon walk. However, as I reached around the 30th episodes, I started to get confused due to the increasing number of characters’ names (_sahabah, sahabiyyah_) introduced in each episode. So, if you have difficulty remembering characters’ name like me, I highly recommend taking notes while listening. Or perhaps, if you prefer reading over learning through listening, this [transcript](https://arqadhi.blogspot.com/2015/11/001-specialties-of-prophet-muhammad-saw.html#more) can be incredibly useful for you, especially for the first 20 episodes (the rest haven’t been published yet).

### Women in Islam

[Builders of A Nation by Dr. Haifaa Younis – Jannah Institute](https://consent.youtube.com/m?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fplaylist%3Flist%3DPL1ABUur57Rl4y7kM7HXSYc0subYNJf9M2%26cbrd%3D1&gl=DE&m=0&pc=yt&cm=2&hl=en-GB&src=1)  
Released in Ramadhan 2023, this series sheds light on the roles and impacts of influential women in Islamic history. At the very least, what we can do now is to learn from their stories, as they should be our role models. Who is your favorite? Mine are mother of Imam Bukhari and mother of Imam Al Shafi.

### _Tarbiyah_ (Education)

[Bonded Hearts, Noble Minds: Islamic Home Schooling 101 by Alasna Institute](https://www.alasna.org/courses/islamic-homeschooling-101)  
Homeschooling was completely unfamiliar concept to me but hearing the arguments, and having myths debunked by Umm Khalid, it gives me some main ideas that: “Homeschooling is just a natural extension of parenting, and perhaps especially motherhood.” Without being too simplistic, so, if you’re a parent, you’re already teaching your child a myriad of things right from the moment he opens his eyes and takes his first breath. You’re already practicing the role of a teacher, and homeschooling is a continuation of what you’re already doing.
Lastly, the prophetic model for education consists of three main stages: 1) Play (ages 0-7) 2) Discipline (ages 7-14) 3) Companionship (ages 14-21). In the early stage, the primary focus is on playing and following the interests of children. This is quite different from mainstream education, where children are schooled in an institution at the earliest opportunity, and where playtime and accommodation to interests become less.

### Halaqa

[Weekly Halaqas by Alasna Institute](https://www.alasna.org/courses/weekly-halaqas)
Lecture, discussion, and QnA session on various topics with Alasna instructors (almost) every Saturday. You can attend it live, ask questions via video/ voice or by typing through chat, or even participate silently.
