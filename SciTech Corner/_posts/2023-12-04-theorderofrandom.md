Been dealing with crystal structures for solid-state-electrolyte in my thesis work and have observed that the most stable structure, in terms of energy, is the one that's arranged quite chaotically.  
It seems that nature tends to behave in a highly unordered manner. Nature has the tendecy to be chaotic. Take, for example, a forest, where trees, bushes, plants grow sporadically unlike a city or housing area, where humans bring order to locate any building as well-arranged as possible.  
Nevertheless, both arrangements are necessary in their own way.  

If stability is a mess, then be chaotic!
