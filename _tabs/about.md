Hi, I'm Azka Firdaus. Welcome to my personal website, where I record random thoughts, ideas, research, and, last but not least, life in general. 

A little about me: an electrical engineer turned computational materials science enthusiast, who occasionally becomes a [classical music concert](https://www.youtube.com/@zkalation) hopper, also loves to [escape responsibilities](https://www.strava.com/athletes/97506273) by being outdoors, do [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/azkasavanti/), doodle for unwinding, try new cooking/ baking recipes on weekend, and [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5073012-azka-savanti) in my spare time or attempt to make time for it.

Let's connect, and if you want to contact me, my e-mail address is [a.to.z.firdaus@gmail.com](mailto:a.to.z.firdaus@gmail.com).
