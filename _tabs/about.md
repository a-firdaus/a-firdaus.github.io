Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Azka Firdaus. Welcome to my personal website, where I record random thoughts, ideas, research, and, last but not least, life journey in general. 

A little about me: a trained electrical engineer turned computational materials science enthusiast who's either programming or programming myself to get back to programming, such as: being outdoors to [run ~~from responsibilities~~](https://www.strava.com/athletes/97506273), doodling for unwinding, and [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5073012-azka-savanti) in my spare time or attempting to make time for it. Whenever I have the chance, I hop in to [classical music concerts](https://www.youtube.com/@zkalation), and travel around, immortalizing the journey through photographs.

Let's connect, and if you want to contact me, my e-mail address is [a.to.z.firdaus@gmail.com](mailto:a.to.z.firdaus@gmail.com).
